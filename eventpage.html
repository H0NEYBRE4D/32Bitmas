<h1>Wishing you a Happy Holidays 
<br>and a Bright New Year... </h1>

<hr class="star">

<p>To get into the festive season and celebrate the start of a new year, we're hosting a community event with various ways for you to participate. Feel free to participate in as many ways as you'd like! 
<p><b>The deadline to submit is January 10,</b> so we can have some time to code the final event display page.</p>

<h3>📝 Join the Blog Carnival</h3>
<p><b>Reflect on 2023 and/or what's to come.</b> Perhaps you'd like to share some highlights of 2023 or look forward to intentions or goals you have for the new year. On your blog, write a post or poem to join in on the fun. This was inspired by <a href="https://indieweb.org/indieweb-carnival">the IndieWeb Carnival.</a></p>

<h3>🎊 Share your holiday traditions or make new ones</h3> 
<p>Whether it's a blog post or stand-along webpage, we'd love to hear how you get festive and enjoy this time of year!</p>

<h3>📀 Create a gift to the smol web in the form of a graphic.</h3>
<p>Not sure where to start? How about using a template from one of our Pixel Club Partners, so you can join the club while also participating in this event at the same time!</p>

<h3>🧑‍🎄 Secret Santa</h3>
<p>When you fill out the participation form, you can tell your "Secret Santa" things you like, and your assigned Santa will create something for you. The event planners will assign "Secret Santas" to ensure each person who participates will create a gift and get a gift.</p>
<p><b>Please note:</b> This is meant to be a creative activity and gifts should not be physical nor monetary in nature. Examples of acceptable digital gifts include a playlist, illustration, poem, etc.</p>
<p>Please be mindful of your own personal bandwidth when signing up for this as it would suck if folks didn't get a gift after spending time crafting one for another person. Schedule some quality time to create a nice, personal gift.
